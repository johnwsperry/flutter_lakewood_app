# How to write documentation in Markdown
# Making words bigger:
Using "#", "##", or "###" in a new line makes your words bigger. There must be a space between the hashtags and your content. 
Example: "# content"

One Hashtag(#)
# The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Two Hashtags(##)
## The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Three Hashtags(###)
### The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

# Formatting Text:
Using \*\*(content)\*\* makes content **bold**.

Using \*(content)\* makes content *italic* 

Using a dash, space, then the content (- (content)) on a new line create a bullet point.

Adding more spaces before the - can change the spacing and bullet point.

My Shopping List
- Banana
  - Chocolate 
      - Apples

Three dashes in a row(---) will create a nice separating line.

# Links
To add a clickable link like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0), 
do this: \[(content)\](filepath, link, or heading)

There is no spaces between the bracket part and the parenthesis part. 

If you wrote something like (# Heading) to make the text bigger, you can also make a clickable link there!
